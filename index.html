                    Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with
                    people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. It is currently available in more
                    than 81000 cities and 191 countries worldwide and is a viable option for visitors as it helps
                    them connect and stay with the locals at a reasonable price.<br>
                    Staying in an Airbnb offers a lot of advantages over traditional hotels for prospective
                    travellers to that locale. Airbnb are on an average cheaper than some of the high tier
                    traditional hotels, while offering amenities of the same level.<br>
                    Airbnb also provides an opportunity to travellers to experience and understand the local
                    culture better though their Airbnb hosts, who are often locals themselves.<br>
                    Throughout this project a central question has been what are the factors effecting the price of a listing.
                    Through using the techniques learned in the unit we have narrowed it down to a few facotrs which you will be seeing further below.<br>
                    The correlation matrix allows you to see the correlation between the different attributes available to us in teh dataset.
                    Click on a cell if allow you to do a more indepth analysis of the attributes and their relation.

                        A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients between variables. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. By hovering over the celss we can see the correlation value between the attributes.

                        We use this plot to determine if there is any type of relation between our selected attributes.
                        For a few attributes we might see a linear, exponential or logarithmic relation between the data of our attributes.
                        Hovering over a point gives us the x and y value of the point.

                        We use this diagram to get a better understanding of the distribution of our data. We can get a quick overview of how our
                        data is segregated among different ranges. We can change the bin size using the provided input box.
                        Hovering over the bar gives us the tid-bits about the selected range.

TODO:

1. ADD MAP CHART MAYBE?
2. ADD CHART DESCRIPTION.
3. Add area for selected attributes near the correlation matrix.
